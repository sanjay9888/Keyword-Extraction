# Keyword-Extraction
The script identifies words in a text that are most influential to a BERT model's prediction, useful for understanding model behavior or extracting key terms in applications like sentiment analysis, text classification, or information retrieval.



Use Case:

Sentiment Analysis: Identify words driving positive/negative predictions.

Explainable AI: Understand which parts of the input text the model relies on.

Keyword Extraction: Extract meaningful terms from user reviews, product descriptions, or medical texts (e.g., "ingredient" and "condition" in a skincare product review).
